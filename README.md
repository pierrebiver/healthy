# Healthy


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is just to learn and try the combination of React, Mobx-state-tree and GraphQl. It is not a commercial product. This is an open source project so feel free, to try it, modify the structure or send me emails if you have any question :smile: 
The root of this project has been generated with the latest stable release of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). :herb: :mushroom: Little app which allows you to filter vegetables by name and season.
